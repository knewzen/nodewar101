+++pls be aware that not all foods providing direct effects to the combat/survival or similar are mentioned here
+++adjust your rotation and build to your needs if you feel like something has to be different depending on your playstyle, class, build, gems etc

Typically you start ur food rotation 1.5 hrs ahead of time, at about 1 hr before you go grab 3 villas full of buffs then you have alch stone, then a party of 5 rotating 3 pots each.

combination of meals differs between 3 and 4 meals. Normal meals are consumed in the case of the combination of 3, but the special is also consumed for the combination of 4
Personally, I prioritize valencia meal over hamburg, and try to time my food buffs so that valencia/margoria are always up at the expense of the others if I have to.
